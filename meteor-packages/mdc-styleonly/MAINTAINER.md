## Update Material Components Version

`material-components-web.json` and `bundle.css` are linked to `package.json` and `material-components-web.css` respectively in `material-components-web` installed in project root.

`material-components-web.json` is used to read in the version of `material-components-web`.

`bundle.css` is simply served by this package.

There is nothing more than updating the package version in `package.json`.

Don't forget to update the change logs.

# Material Components for Meteor (without style)

This package only contains the js files so users can have their own styles.

**Requires Meteor@1.3.3+ (ecmascript@0.4.4+)**

## Install

```Bash
$ meteor add zodiase:mdc-styleless
```

## Get Started

Importing the entire JS bundle:

```JavaScript
import mdc from 'meteor/zodiase:mdc-styleless';
```

Or importing individual JS components:

```JavaScript
import {checkbox as mdcCheckbox, ripple as mdcRipple} from 'meteor/zodiase:mdc-styleless';
```

Please see [the official Material Components repo](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) for more instructions on how to use the library.

## Version

The version of this package should and will match the corresponding NPM package it serves. But since now I'm still figuring things out, it will stay at `0.0.*`.

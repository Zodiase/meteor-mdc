# Material Components for Meteor (with auto-upgrade)

## Proposal

To be compliant to the behavior of the MDL package, this package adds auto-upgrade logics to the MDC package.

Although not recommended, since now MDC provides much more reliable initialization, if you need to save some code and time by auto-upgrading everything, this can help you. Although I have no idea how you can do anything while not able to retrieve the component instances.
